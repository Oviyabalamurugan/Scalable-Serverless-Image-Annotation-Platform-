• Built a scalable, cloud-native backend platform using EC2 Auto Scaling, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and serverless
components (S3, Lambda, RDS MySQL) to support high-availability workflows.



• Implemented event-driven backend processing using EventBridge triggers on S3 ObjectCreated events, enabling
real-time and scalable execution.



• Deployed backend infrastructure within a secure VPC using public/private subnets, IAM roles, and Secrets Manager,
with system monitoring via CloudWatch.
• Conducted load testing using ApacheBench to validate autoscaling behavior under traffic spikes, ensuring stable scale-out
and scale-in performance.
• Tech Stack: AWS EC2, Auto Scaling Group, ALB, S3, Lambda, EventBridge, RDS MySQL, Secrets Manager, VPC,
ApacheBench.
